Equity Ratio and Employees' Average Age (Sector 8): The negative coefficient suggests that companies with a higher equity ratio and older employees may have lower returns. This could be interpreted as firms with more conservative financing (higher equity) and a mature workforce being less aggressive in pursuing high-return, high-risk opportunities.

Employees Fraction Male and Employees' Average Age (Sector 1): A positive coefficient for this interaction might indicate that firms with a higher proportion of male employees and a generally older workforce see better returns. This could be related to industry sectors where experience (often correlated with age) and a traditionally male-dominated workforce are key factors in performance, such as certain manufacturing sectors.

Number of Employees and Equity Ratio (Sector 3): The positive coefficient here suggests that firms with more employees and a higher equity ratio yield better returns. This could reflect that larger, well-capitalized firms benefit from economies of scale and financial stability, which contribute positively to their performance.
